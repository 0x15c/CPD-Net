# CPD-Net

(1) The code is tested with a modern PyTorch stack (no TensorFlow dependency).

(2) For training the model: `python train.py`

(3) For testing the model: `python test.py`

(4) C.D. (Before and After) will be printed out after running `test.py` and the qualitative result for visualization is saved at the `result_visuliation` folder.

(5) For comparison with CPD, we use the package: https://github.com/siavashk/pycpd

(6) `geotnf` is modified based on the code from paper: Convolutional neural network architecture for geometric matching, Ignacio Rocco, Relja Arandjelović, Josef Sivic.
